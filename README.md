# QMTS: Ternary Quantization For Multi-Timescale SNNs
QMTS is an iterative algorithm that quantizes network parameters and neuron states of any SNN. QMTS's iterative approach is tailored for multi-timescale SNNs solving complex temporal problems such as the Spiking Heidelberg Dataset. QMTS can reach SoTA Ternary quantization levels with better accuracy that fp32.
